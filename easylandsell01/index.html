                            It was a very simple process. Even though everything was done remotely, it was just as good as if I was standing in front of the person doing the deal.  Everything was done very simply and it was very easy to do.

                            <p class="faq__content_p">We really don’t need much! Our Sell My Land Form only requires you to list the name the property is listed under with the county, your contact information, and the state and county the property is located in. Adding additional information is recommended and filling out the form as completely as possible will help us research your property and get you an offer in less time.</p>

                            <p class="faq__content_p">The market for raw land is limited and it can often take months or years to sell a land property on your own. Finding bank financing for land is difficult, which means you’ll typically have to find cash buyers for your property. Many land properties are marketed with owner financing arrangements, meaning the owners must deal with the hassle of collecting monthly payments for years. </p>

Any back taxes or dues will be negotiated as part of our offer prior to reaching an agreement. In the case that money is owed in back taxes or dues, those amounts can be deducted from the final closing price.
